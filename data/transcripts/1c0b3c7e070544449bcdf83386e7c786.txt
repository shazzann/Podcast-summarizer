Let's bridge the gap between ancient practices in cutting-edge medicine. Let's get started. Hello, I'm your host Dr. Chris Motley. I'm host with HL podcast. And today I get to interview CJ Merz, who is a global strategist, and he strategizes with chiropractors, doctors, businesses all over the world. And you strategize in my opinion, I want you to talk about it, not only just business aspects, which leads to beautiful success, but you also strategize about people's leadership skills and how to actually develop internally. That's what I've seen. And a quick backstory, when I was in chiropractors school, I remember we would hear the words of CJ Merz. And those quotes, there were quotes that they would tell us to study that would help us develop as a chiro. And I'm really appreciative of that. So first of all, thank you so much for joining me today. Oh, it's a privilege. I'm happy to be here. I know people out there probably know who you are, but I still, I loved to know like you to tell me a little bit about yourself. Yes, yes. Well, I would say that the only reason why I'm sitting here in front of you is because I had a horrible injury when I was 10 years old. And so it left a fiery pain up my back. I was unable to walk and assisted. I was rushed to a hospital. The doctor that was there with my mom said that I needed to have this procedure right away. The good news is that I would get most of the feeling and function of my legs back, but I would never play sports. Again, I would have a wobble in my walk. My spine would deteriorate faster than it would have normally like that was the best news that my mom was hearing. So do you remember the rotary phones? Oh, I do not use command. So my mom never forget this on 10 years old. And she walks out into the lobby. And she calls somebody. Now I'd never heard the word chiropractic or chiropractor, but my mom called her chiropractor on a Saturday. Somehow he winds a bansoring that phone. And he can hardly hear what she's saying because she's crying. She's freaked out right? And he just says, listen, my mom's name is Asta. Asta, you need to get your son to my office. Take whatever MRI is take whatever x-ray that you can. My mom wheelchairs me out of that hospital. What's on there forget puts me in our station wagon. And I wind up at this other doctor. It's office. He's a chiropractor. Right? And so he's looking at whatever my mom brought. He takes his own films. He does his own tests. And what he says to my mom, which on there forget is he said, you know, it's as bad as they said it was, but we'll never know unless we try. And so I saw him for 30 days. He told my mom that if I couldn't see any results any improvement in 30 days, he was now I was in North and California at that time. He was going to refer me to another chiro, which was about 45 minutes north of where we were, which was kind of an expert in this low-back trauma that I had experienced. And then he said, and if he doesn't see any improvement with him, after 30 days, we're going to send you a son to the middle of the country who at that time was considered the finest chiropractor on earth with this problem. And here I am 10 years old. And I look back on it now. What I was realizing is what he taught me was chiropractic first. Chiropractic second chiropractic third. Like there was a lot of different options here. And if all of that couldn't somehow help my body heal itself again, you'd have to go back in and get what they said. Well, I don't remember getting better in 30 days. I don't have a memory of that. All I know is, I didn't leave that first chiropractor. I stayed with him. And six months later, I'm hopping, skipping and jumping like it never happened. Praise God. Yeah. To the point where I wound up actually going on a full ride to play tennis through college, which I was never supposed to play sports again. So like all the things that I heard, all the things my mom and dad heard, they were just lies. They were just, they were not right. Let's just put it that way. And so this chiropractor changed my life. You know, and that's, that's, I think that's why I'm here with you because my mom tells me it was about six months later. I'm in my well visits now to this chiropractor. And I'm driving home and I say to my mom, you know, I think it'd be really cool, mom. If I could do this one day for another boy or girl, you know, who's who's had to go through what I went through. So I think sometime before I was 11 years old, I knew I was going to be right here. That's right. I mean, when you went through that experience at that age, I think that the best, I guess the best learning curve for you to be a teacher, you know, is like when you have to go and experience something in that way, when you started to, even at that age, you knew you wanted to help people. And the route you chose now, like when it started to after college, you went on a full ride of tennis then. I, tennis is no joke. I played a lot of basketball in high school and tennis is its own beast. It's so strong. And so a hard, when you started to make that transition into giving, you know, great advice, great leadership, what brought you into this round? Like going into it, advising and such because there's only a special type of person that can do that kind of thing. Like because you have that the ability to people to want to listen to you. Not if I had that ability. Well, and I think that really came from the Lord, it came from my dad, but it also came from being stuck. So, so let's fast forward. I'm now in chiropractic practice. I've now graduated and I get the chance to do what happened for me. I wind up getting stuck. Now, I know you know the average chiropractor today, their practice serves somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 90 patient visits a week. That would be the average chiropractor. Okay. So my practice was right about there. It was maybe just tipping at a hundred patient visits a week. And my practice got stuck. Well, just I'm telling you, it was so frustrating. And I'm trying different things, working hard, but it didn't really seem to make any difference at all. And so I'm just a hundred patient visits a week. And I love the results that I'm getting with my patients. But just so frustrated that why isn't it just exploding? Why is there not more people that I can help? And I had this big heart really big heart and purpose to save the world with what it is that saved me. Right? And I'm just stuck. And so I look back on it now and five amazing mentors came into my life. And I look back at it now. It's like literally in the order that I needed to experience them. And in six months, in the same town, in the same location, in the same office where I was stuck, completely stuck at a hundred patient visits a week. My practice is now serving a hundred people a day. And I'm having to grow my team. I'm having to really understand how do I do that and maintain the highest standards of service and result for our patients. And eight months after that, we're serving a hundred people before lunch, a hundred people after lunch. And so again, I'm having to grow the business mind and the business strategies to serve all the people that wanted their mom, their sister, their children. It just continued to flow that way. It was so beautiful. It was almost, oh, as magical. It really was. And so what happened was totally a shocker to me. Carpactors started finding out about this. It wound up being one of the largest practices that's ever been built in the United States. And it was a cash-based subluxation center. So, corrective wellness practice. We'll talk a little bit more about that. But yeah, I'm so I had Carpactors 10, 15 a week coming into my practice because they heard about it. And I know what they were hoping for and for was that I'd be able to help them replicate what it was that they were witnessing, right? But see, I never learned what I had learned to teach other caros. I learned it to help my town. I learned it to help the families and the children and the people of my town. So, I really didn't say anything to these carpactors. I said, just watch, just come in and learn. And so they would do that, but they were frustrated because it wasn't enough to just see it. They had to, they needed something else. And so God led me again. It was like, one, almost one year later to the day, I began a coaching program. And that's where some of the things you mentioned a few minutes ago, which are now in most of the carpactic colleges around the world. And we'll talk about that. But yeah, I wound up actually doing something. I didn't think I would be doing, which was coaching carpactors. And I realized very early by talking to them. They had the same prop. They were stuck. And they were stuck for the exact same reasons. I was stuck in practice. And so we just found those barriers, those problems, those challenges gave them all the systems and strategies and solutions and how do you hire team and develop them and all the things that we're missing. And so now that was in the last three decades, I look back at that. Now, this is three decades. I've had the blessing of coaching just over 16,000 carapactic teams in 20 countries, 20 countries that speak in 12 different languages. And that all came from a 10 year old boy that got hurt and that got helped by one carapactor. So wow, it's just the exponential growth of information or healing. He created that. What was when Doc, when you started, you were stuck. And maybe I know people can have different versions of while they're stuck. But what did you find kept you stuck? Was it a mindset? Was it? I met a hundred people a week. And then what was the thing that those docks, those, you know, they came in and say, this is what you would need to do to grow? Was it something that you're going to do mentally, spiritually or just like physically? Yeah, that is such a great question. And I would say it included all of it because if it was just one of those, you would probably gravitate it to it and fix it quicker. I think it was just mental or if it was just physical. You could get to it quicker. But that wasn't me. That wasn't my experience. And I realized for most carapactors, it's the multi-dimensional fullness of what you just said for example, I had one of those carapactors. This was before I started coaching. He just came into my practice. Think about this. He's literally seeing what I'm doing and not believing it. Because in his world and in his practice, the most you could ever do is a hundred patient visits a week. The most you could, I mean, that would be, there's no other way. I mean, he was so convinced there is no way that you, and of course he'd never seen anything else. And so he walks into my practice. He flew to come see this practice. He's in this practice and what he experienced on that morning shift. Yeah. Was what he does in a whole week. I saw in a morning what he did the whole week. And it was, is meant, it was mentally torturous for him because he had to open up his mind to go so you, you just, you can do that. I don't know, you tell me, you've been here for three hours. Look, look, look what just happened. And he's like, and they're getting well, and they're still coming back and they're telling, I mean, he literally saw referrals happening in front of his eyes. Like, people just talking about their neighbor and I need to get my brother and it was just, it was natural. That's how it works in my office. None of that was real in his practice. But it was also not real in mind when I was stuck. So I was a empathetic with him. So it took him, you know, another month or so to kind of soften his heart and open his eyes to the possibility that that could happen. So to answer your question, you know, if you have a mental image that this is the way it needs to get done and there's no way the way to do it and you can't do this and you can't do that. I just would say that self-limitating self-limitations, right? That's right. And so not much, no coach would really help you until you could at least open your heart to go, wow, wait a second, what if what if you could exist? And he saw that you could break through yourself limitations. When you broke through yourself limitations, and you think, well, I could go further, how long did that take? Like, some people out there listening would be like, in anything in life, I have a limited, limiting belief and it would be uncomfortably spiritually physically to break through that. Financially, financially as well. So let me speak into that. So here my, I'm growing. Good news is, I'm no longer stuck. And somehow, and if we have time, I'll describe some of this in detail, but so I'm growing now. And then I get stuck again, self-inflicted. Okay, so I had this with my team that we were going to break $40,000 collected in a month. We had not done that up to that, right? So my team has got bonuses. We're all on purpose. We know what we should do to get there and whatnot. Okay, so I'm adjusting, and this is probably four days, four, five days, before the end of the month. So I'm not expecting, and I'm not even keeping track of any of my numbers right now. My team's doing that. I just, I wasn't in numbers at that time. And I happened to finish this set of adjusting and my CA Vivian comes up to me. And she's just as excited as I've ever seen her. And I wasn't sure why. And I was going to go see another patient in about two minutes. So she comes up quietly. She gives me this high five and this hug and it's like, we did it. We did it. And I honestly, I'm like, what did I do? Right? Because we're not at the end of the month. You're like, okay, I'm excited about like, what did we do? She goes 40,000. And I got to tell you, I was as excited as you could possibly match. I mean, honest, I just gave this big hug. I'm like, wow, yeah. Because obviously, we were going to blow that number away because we still had four or five days left, right? I was like, oh my gosh. And I'm telling you within 20 seconds, I felt the need to go back to my office. And I knew that was going to be another patient or two. I needed to take care of. And I literally started having tears developing in my eyes. And now they're streaming down my face. I don't even know exactly why that's happening. But I went from total elation to I was almost ashamed. Like, it was it was 180 degrees. And then it hit me like a ton of bricks. My dad worked graveyard. So that if my brothers or I needed tennis shoes or a tennis racket or something, he could make a little extra money if he worked through the night. Only later did I realize as a teenager that that word graveyard, what they've learned about that is if you work, you know, starting like 10 o'clock at night and get off at like 10 o'clock in the morning. Their lifespan is cut by at at least 10 years. They die 10 years earlier because you're completely off your circadian rhythms. Right? My dad knew that and decided to do that for my mom and the four children that he had. And I just started to now fast-forwarding back into, we just crushed 40,000, right? We just cried. I mean, I was so excited. And I realized it took my dad a year to make 40,000. And I just did that in a month. And honestly, he was my hero. I was just hoping in my life. I'd become half the man that he was and man, I don't know how to say it, but I just felt dirty. I felt unworthy. Like, like the very thing that just like I set this goal and I achieved it, I'll tell you what, over the next two months, I sabotaged that, not consciously, but we didn't get close to 40,000. And my team was wondering what the heck's going on, right? So I wind up with my dad and we're at this place and it's just dad time. And he says, hey, CJ, how's it going? I go, yeah, it's going good, you know? And it was one of those moments where it goes, no, no really, what's going on? And I hadn't told him a single thing about this, you know? And then I thought, man, if I don't tell him, I don't know if I'll ever get past this. And he's probably the one person I can say to, so I told him this story I just told you. And he listened carefully. And I could see his eyes were getting shiny. He said, okay, I get that. I really do. He said, but you're missing a piece. And I said, well, one of my missing goes, do you understand that your dream is my dream now and you are pissing me off. And I just started laughing and crying and laughing. And it was like in that moment, he gave me permission to go past where he was, you know, like, no, you're good. Yeah, you're good. I know there's a lot of healing. You need to get done. There's a lot of people need to get under your hands. Don't let me get in the way of that. Your dream is my dream. Do you know, I went from 40,000 a month to 40,000 a week. What? Six months, eight months later. Praise God. And these mentors that came into my life, they showed me how to grow my practice. And so I made all kinds of changes. It was no uncomfortable. I'm going to tell you right now, you know, any changes uncomfortable, right? But I was so committed to it that I was like, how could I let any uncomfortable change in a procedure and a script and in how I'm hiring or training? How could I let any of that get in the way? But yeah, I still acknowledge my dad for that one moment that, you know, he released it for me. I mean, I'm really like soaking that in. So when you went to 40,000 a week, he gave you the permission in a way to help you release that limiting belief. You were saying, he's like, I want you to expand. Don't stay here. Where like, not putting down what he did. He worked hard. He's of saying, I want you to grow because you're my offspring. I want you to like you be get bigger. Yeah. And he knew my purpose, you know, because it was never about money. I'm saying 40,000 a month. Please do not think. Oh, no, it was just, yeah, because really it's about how many people's lives were extended, improved, saved. It just, I'm just giving a metric of just that. And so when when I started coaching, you know, I was able to share that story because it was a very important question you asked a few minutes ago of, so is it mental? Is it physical? I think it's all those things because over time, what I've realized talking to so many caripactors is the limitations that we have set upon ourselves and they've just stayed there. I'm a, I'm the caripactors that have been practicing now for 25, 30 years that have been stuck since the first two or three years of their practice. And just, you know, and praise God that I got a chance to meet them, help them free it up. Imagine 25 years later, they're now busting through 200 a week, 300 a week. They're doing things in that practice. They only dreamed of decades ago and what hurts my heart is to think, what would happen if they would have just learned how to free that up, you know, two decades ago, where would they be now? So that's why when you started telling the story in this podcast about you hearing my name, which just again is just such a blessing in school, I realized I had to take my coaching curriculum and put it into the school's life university, life care, practising, just being one of the first. So as these students are going through college, think about this, they're learning my coaching system, and getting credit for it towards college. So when they get out of school, they actually have a sense of, no, this is how you fundamentally set up your practice. This is how you grow it, right, as opposed to, as you know, you graduated and you're like, what do you do? What do you just throw you out there? Right, I would, what else else to do? Just open up a door and see if people come in, but you gave a system. And today, today, the average chiropractic student graduate is $250 to $300,000 in debt. They can't wait three years, four years, ten years to get a slow, roll, you know, in practice. So they come. No, and I think that's one testament about how you, how God, my opinion, how God sees how one person could affect so many people's lives so that they could open up and release a limiting belief. And I mean, I know I loved it here about, I do like to talk about it a lot, but when you say you go meet somebody who's had for two decades or stuck, you know it can be mental, physical, emotional. Is there like, what is, let's say mentally? Is there a limiting belief that you see commonly? Like, you know, you had it with your, you know, your dad's situation, is it usually like a familial thing or is it just something like they're like, I'm not good enough to make money? Is it something learned from their family? Is there a common one you start to say? That's so good. Yes, the answer is yes. And I would say it's a collective set. It's not one. So and I'm not going to even put them in order to me. They're all one, if you will. But for sure, self-worth, you know, if, if I can't visualize myself, earning 300,000 a year, it really doesn't matter what I do in terms of changing anything, adding certain new equipment or technology, making a strategy, starting some new marketing. If I, if I don't believe that I could ever be worth 300,000 a year, I'm going to prove that. And I'm going to continue to be the 180,000 a year person and I have to pay all my expenses. So by the end of the year, I don't have much left. I worked hard. You know, I mean, I'm working so hard. But so for me, a big part of it is actually learning where those limitations are and if there's a self-worth issue, we break right through it and we can do that quickly. It's amazing how many times I see people for years that have had that. Yes. But how quickly you can overcome it, which is a blessing. Vitamins and minerals are the most basic parts of nutrition. And according to a 2022 study, 97% of American adults have at least one mineral deficiency. We don't realize it, but we're all short on minerals. The food we eat isn't as nutritious as it used to be and it's really costing us in our health. Minerals can dictate your mood, energy levels, hormones, physical performance. They're the foundation of vitality in your body. That's why I partnered with being minerals because they make it really easy to replenish your minerals stores. All you do is take a shot of mineral rich liquid every morning. I do it each morning before my cup of tea. It tastes like water and it gives you every essential mineral your body needs and the right ratios with fast absorption. I'm notice taking beam minerals has really helped me with my energy levels, keeping them sustained as I work on patients throughout the day. So if you need sustained energy throughout your work day, I highly recommend beam minerals. Head to beam minerals.com slash Dr. Molly and use a code Dr. Molly. That's DR, MOT, L-E-Y, at checkout for 20% off your first order. Another one, which I'm sure you're totally integrated with, but our colleges have really diluted the philosophical training. Wow, two chiropractors. And so while the philosophy is not diluted 1%, the way it's been taught or not even taught it all, there are colleges. Now the green books are not even on the campus. So the idea of like BJ Palmer, like who is that, you know, and what did he teach? It just isn't there. So what I realize is these chiropractors, unbeknowning, they've been building relief care practices where patients do come in. They stay for a few visits. There's some initial improvement. Oh gosh, I'm moving a little better. You know, I can turn a little better. I feel a little bit there. I'm sleeping a little there's gratitude. There's appreciation. They're gone. These patients are gone. Seven visits, eight visits, nine visits later. These chiropractors are so frustrated because somehow internally, they're like, I don't think this is how this was supposed to work, but they're not educating their patients because they were never educated themselves to become the teacher, right? So I get a hold of someone like that. And I say, okay, write down the names, first first names of the last five patients that you adjusted. And so it's Mary and Bill and so forth. Right? And I say to them, okay, if I was with them right now, if they were in front of me right now, which one of them could say that their nerve system controls every function in their body? And I would just stop talking, and they would look at that list and they'd go, hmm, no, I don't think anybody would say that. I say, okay, okay. So those five, they're under your hands, they're getting adjusted, but none of them knows or believes that their brain does all the healing to their body and that the nerve system controls every function, it controls all the healing, all the repair, all the metabolism, they don't know that, no, they don't know that. Okay. So let's talk about the three T's, negative fats, toxins, and traumas. Those three is what stress is defined as stress is negative, thoughts, toxins, traumas. And it turns out stress in any of those forms, attacks the nerve system first, which one of those five could actually look at you and say, oh, the stress is because you and I know we have stress when you agree, all of us, every different one, right? Exactly. I was reading recently, it said that we are in contact with up to 500 toxins a day now, five in the United States of America, right? Not your fault, not my fault. So when you think about just negative thoughts would anxiety, fear, worry, doubt, you know, that creep, that creep in during a day, all these toxins that if you just get in your car, you just go to your house. I mean, just the things that you do, you go to work. There's these toxins, the food we eat and so forth. And then traumas are not just car accidents and sports injuries, we're sitting right now, you know, and just the way we are posture is and so forth and so on. So stress attacks the nerve system first. How many of those five know that? Nobody knows that. And so I would ask him no more than three more questions and it became just to the chiropractor going, are you telling me that your patients would say this? And I would say, well, when I was stuck, the truth is not not many, the truth is not many, but as my practice went from 40,000 a month to 40,000 a week, I can't think of anyone that couldn't tell me that. And he was just like, how's that possible? And I said, because I decided that's where the bar would be set. Oh, that's amazing. Right. Like, why would I be adjusting? Why would I want to be adjusting you? No, because you and I know what the power of an adjustment is. Like, I don't have to talk you into that. But if you just got adjusted for me, but you don't know that your nerve system controls everything in your body. How could you possibly know the power and the fullness of that adjustment? Right. Stress attacks the nerve system first. How could you possibly know the value of my wellness program, which I can't wait to get into that with you here. How would you possibly come a wellness patient? If you didn't know that stress is the reason why vertebra go out of alignment that actually caused nerve interference that doesn't allow the body to function properly, but you are getting adjusted, but you don't know that. Yeah. That's right. Well, this is just part of answering your question of what are the things that chiropractors might be mentally stuck on. These are those things. And so as I find them and help them push through those, I'm telling you this for a reason, it happens very quickly. That's true. They can get on the other side of that very quickly. And what I realized was my journey of growth was not just unique to me. The number of therapy, think about this. Today, right now, we have over 112 practices around the world that serve over a thousand patient visits a week in my program. Over 500 practices serving over 500 a week. And there's over 3000 chiropractors today serving over 300 patient visits a week. And I say all of that because when I meet them, most of them were stuck at a hundred patient visits a week. And now I look at how they're serving their communities and how they're serving those families and how they're growing their teams as beautiful. And I mean, it's the way it should be. I'm thinking with you and I'm not speaking for, I would think that when you, I'm asking when you taught your the docs in your program, like, would they know that the nervous system is a master control system? So for people listening that maybe they're not chiropractors, maybe they're not doctors. But what I'm hearing is that you became a teacher. You said you need to educate if you teach it enough. Like, I would think they say repetition. I mean, they say repetition makes you like, I don't know how many hours, 10,000 hours, 10,000 makes you a master at it. So you're saying like, I became a master at talking about this. But I also believe that, I mean, the energy behind your practice must have expanded with that information because you know, they say like that energetic field around you because you just kept educating and educating it. And so the patient, they become teachers too, right? Like, that was the key. You just unlocked the vault with what you just said. It couldn't be that I'm the one who knows it. It needed to be my patient needed to be the one that knew it. And here's what I realized. People do not know where sickness comes from and they do not know where health comes from. And the moment I give them the answers to this is how your body gets sick every time. And this is how your body heals every time. That's true for you. That's true for your spouse. That's true for your children. Wow. That's true for your brother, your sister, your mom and your dad is true for that man that works right next to you at job. In other words, I'm always teaching not just for you personally, but your friends and family, your friends and you. I never did that when I was stuck. Never did it when I was there. Honestly, I mean, it was almost like I'm caring for you. And at some point later, if perhaps you said there was a friend that you thought to come see me, that was great, but it wasn't really an integral part of how I was leading you and how I was teaching you and how I was managing your care. I didn't do it that way. But through these mentors and the way in which I developed the system that I teach now, right? Family and friends are from the beginning. Family and friends, but it's all from this is how the body gets sick every time. Exactly. This is how the body heals every time from the above down inside out. And I want you to know that for the rest of your life, I want you out of the confidence to know this being and how it works. Right? And then you could go tell somebody at work or you could tell a neighbor, you maybe you're at a family reunion and somebody's having something like, hey, listen, how was that my care factor? And you know, I'm not a doctor, but this is what I learned your nerve system and it's coming right out of their mouth, word for word. It actually controls everything. And I know that because I was at one of those family reunions totally serendipitously. Yeah. This person is the patient of mine. Doesn't even know that I'm actually sort of behind. And you know, you're like, I thought that. It's like, yeah. Wow. I couldn't actually couldn't have said it. Any better than it. Right? So whenever it was incredible. It's like, this doesn't just apply to like, I mean, just the dogs. This is like people in their lives like if you, if you're in a business and you, and you believe what you're doing. So I want to, there's two parts. I want to talk about your wellness program. So you, you have a business and if you have a clinic, you're teaching them to educate. I'm asking. Yeah. And they believe it. And I notice two in practice is that whenever I do my, when I do my best is kind of give my snippet like, this is really what I believe is happening in your body. And they kind of grasp it. They do grasp it and they'll go, oh, then they tell all their friends like, oh, they found out this. This and then those three people that they talk to, they're like, oh, I got to come see it because I had that issue. Yeah. So you created a beautiful like network of people who are educated that feel empowered. I would say, because I, that would be like a big business. Okay. So empowerment's great. But did you find like when you're and you started to educate, did you find that it, it filled your passion when you started to educate more like, did that was at a big piece of your like life that you went now, I'm more excited about it or yes, I know. I would say that where the passion came from was when I saw that they could teach it. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Because you're a teacher at heart like you're, yeah. So me teaching it was good. Them spreading it magic magic magic dust man. It was like, and I didn't actually think that that could happen or happen as quickly and as virally as it did and as still does remember this is not happening in 20 countries in 12 languages. So this happens anywhere. This happens everywhere. Right. This is not limited to culture, language, you know, small town, big town, rural town, you just spread the message. You saw that. I read the leave of the book. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. And you know, I suspect that we're in a time and an age now where people have been so beat down by all they've been offered is medication. Right. I mean, so it's all outside in and if the medication doesn't work, then we're going to go into a surgery. You know, and it's just as sort of as far as we've were still right where we were 100 years ago, which was given madrug and if it doesn't work, cut the part out. Right. And so there's actually a, there's a system. And I want to just shortly share that with you. I would love it. I hear it into wellness. Right. So what I say to my patients is it's literally called the law of addition and subtraction. And so what this means is if you go into a traditional medical practice, they're going to ask you questions and they're going to find out what your pain is and what's going on right with your life. And what they're going to do is they're going to add medication. They're going to add medication. Right. And if it happens to work in your headaches gone or whatever it is, you don't see them again. You're not taking that medication and it just seems to be your, your out there in the world. Right. And you haven't really learned anything new, but that was the result. If that medication doesn't work, they're going to give you a higher dose or a more advanced medication, something that I'm even be off the market that has all kinds of other side effects that could be worse than what you're dealing with in the symptoms that you came in in the first place. Right. But they're going to actually add as far as they can add in terms of medication. And when they've added all the medication that they can't and just there's no more meds that we can use, the law of subtraction, we're just going to subtract the part, the gland. Oh, we're the organ. Do you understand? Yeah. We add into we can't add. And then after the surgery, it was a success. Somehow the surgery was a success because you no longer have that organ as if God made us to have her move in all kinds of organs and glands and it was a success. Right. And somehow the headaches gone, which is really what we wanted to see happen. But look what we had to do to get there when the body could heal itself if the nerve system was given the proper opportunity to do so. Right. And so yeah, these people understand the law of addition and subtraction. So they can make up their own mind about, do I want to keep going that? Do I want my son to go in that direction? Do I want my husband to go down that road or or can you tell me what is wellness? So when you do that, then another path, another path is like, is it okay, we're going to get you out your headaches. But you're going to have to maintain this because we want you down that path. That's right. That's exactly right. So today, there are over 10,000 carapactors. I want you to really get this now that all have a wellness program called club C in their practices and it's their wellness program. So when you think about the millions of people that are in a club like this, you're starting to see the movement and really where my excitement comes because these carapactors when I first meet them and remember, I was stuck. I want to go back to that. I had very few patients that were really under regular wellness care for life. But if you asked me, Dr. CJ, do you believe in wellness care? I was a wellness care patient. Remember, I mean, since 10 years old, I have been under regular carapactor care. There's no way you could stop me from that. I mean, so I've been under carapactor care for well over 50 years of my life. There's no way that you could tell me anything that would be anything more powerful than getting your spine and nervous system. Check. But here I am the carapactor. I've got very few people under wellness care. So when I tell you, I went from 40,000 a month to 40,000 a week and then more. I teach our clients about front or side-doring backdoor and the backdoor of their practice my friend is the wellness program. It's people that already got through corrective care and now learn that there are three teas, negative thoughts, toxins and traumas, they're with us every day. They are what can cause that sublations. They can create nerve interference and they can create poor health, a loss of immune strength and all kinds of other things. Why then would you wait for a year, two years, three years to come back and see me? Let's get checked every other week. Let me make sure your nerve system is functioning at 100% all year long. These are people now, are investing somewhere between 1,000 and 2,500 a year based on the plan that they're on. So I have clients today, my friend, that on January 1st, they already know they're collecting 500,000 dollars because these are all people that are already in their wellness club. This is how you grow the most successful, those powerful, the most amazing practices on earth. It's by being able to teach and lead people how to get to wellness, how to how to make chiropractic care and inroquer part of their wellness program. Does that make sense? It's a totally mixed sense because I put the wellness program. I went into vigils, go through the trenches, and they're hurting, and you went through it with them, and they realized, like, do I ever want to go back? I would always think that, I mean, I've had my issues, my health issues. I always thought personally, I would rather spin money to just keep things maintained because I'm like, I never want to go back whether or not because sometimes people like, well, I got it fixed and I'm done like, man, I'm never going back. I try to teach myself, I love myself enough in a positive way that I don't want to do that. You never go back. That's exactly right. That chiropractor with that wellness program is also going to be very diligent to make sure that they also know what you eat is very important. We're not just saying, get adjusted. I'm not saying that. That's fine, in our system, we need that functioning at 100% posture is the window to your spine and nerve system. So we need to make sure we're checking that on a regular basis. But what you eat, staying hydrated, exercising, being fit, being flexible, having the right sleep. These are all, that should be part of your wellness plan, right? But in the heart, in the center of it is, how's your nerve system? Because remember, your nerve system controls what? Yeah, so it doesn't matter. If you're working out five days a week, but your spine and nerve system are not healthy, you're not healthy. That's right. If you're eating wonderfully, right, but your spine and nerve systems off, you can't be healthy. So how do you define health? How do you actualize health? Having a plan and a belief system, you know that you can build from. I appreciate this because I think the way you described it, Doc, was like the original, and I'm not saying this about age or anything or being, you know, speeds are casting. But like original like Instagram TikTok because what they say is you, you know, you want to, you want to put out a reel in the morning midday at night or something because you're always reminding the people out there about what you believe. And that's what you did. You like, I'm going to live it. And I'm going to tell you about it. And that's going to create an energy around who I am and around this practice. So you already did marketing one, you did, you had to hyper marketing back in the day and you did it because you had an event when you were 10 years old. That's right. But I realized now that you don't have to have an event at 10 years old to do that just happened to be, you know, what led me there. But I'm telling you what, if anybody that's listening that is a carer prerager or wellness practitioner has been stuck or is stuck, they can get unstuck and they can get unstuck pretty quick and they can be helping all the people that they've all believed they have the ability to help. That's right around the corner. Well, Doc, I'm so thankful because I want you to tell people how they can get in touch with you and find out about the programs about, you know, so how can they find you? Well, first of all, they can go to CJmerch.com. And my company is called CJ3 Consulting My Daughters. My wife and I have three daughters that are all CJs. They have different names. That's my name. I love it. So we just named our company after our three daughters, which is great. CJ3 Consulting the name of our coaching program is XLR8. Oh wow. It feels like we're strapping a rocket onto your back and your team's back. In terms of making those changes, we've been talking about for this last several minutes and how you can get to the other side and grow. So we actually are happy to do a practice evaluation. There's no charge. They can schedule time with me. Have 20 to 30 minutes to really just talk about what are those challenges and then how could I possibly help them? And I would be honored to do so. Wow. I love this and we're going to make sure that we put a link in our caption about how people get a hold of you and the programs. I really am thankful to meet you. I mean, over these years, I really mean it's been fun. It's really great. And I just feel like in my heart of heart, you're utilizing how you help people's belief systems and how you can actually encourage their belief system to show it in their patience. And to me, I love the way that you're training people to get them unstuck, train them to have some value. Don, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. And hopefully one day we'll do another podcast and I finally get to meet you. Thanks so much. Have a great day.
