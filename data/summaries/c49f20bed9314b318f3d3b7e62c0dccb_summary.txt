Animals have a reputation for lounging about, but why do some spend so much time doing nothing? Professor Dan Chabano, an expert in insect behavior, discusses the lazy rock ant. Psychologist Dr Sandy Mann thinks being productive, working to produce a lot for the amount of resources we use is overrated.
Boredom is the mother of invention, says Dr Mann. Instead of fearing boredom, we can open up to its benefits by switching off, stopping worrying or thinking about something and relaxing, slowing down helps too. Dr Mann doubts humans would have invented things without the curiosity that comes from being bored.
