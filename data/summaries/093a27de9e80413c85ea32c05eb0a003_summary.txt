Life isn't about how many times you succeed, it's about how often you get back up after you fail. Resilience, the ability to keep going, no matter what, is often the difference between those who make it, and those who don't. You don't need to be a billionaire or a famous athlete to demonstrate resilience. You can practice it every day in your own life.
